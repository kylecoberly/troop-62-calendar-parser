SUMMARY:T62b Intro to Winterwise
DESCRIPTION:**Resent with updated roster again 1/2/24**\n\nTroop!  \nAs part of our annual 3-month winter program\, here is Hynds Lodge 2024!.  This is a lodge-camping outing designed to ease into the winter fun for both the old-hands and first-timers\, please set the date aside in your family calendar\n\nUp to 30 scouts can cram themselves into the semi-heated bunk room upstairs\, and a certain number of adults will enjoy the downstairs sleeping arrangements\, so space is limited.  The building is heated and usually has electricity\, fireplace and a gas/electric kitchen.  Situated in some pretty good Wyoming wilderness\, this is an environment that Colorado scouts understand.  SPL will provide details as we get closer so watch this space.  Registration will close Jan 9 for driving arrangements and food planning!

SUMMARY:Sand Dunes Campout
DESCRIPTION:Update 2.13.0\nThe annual Spring Campout at the Great Sand Dunes National Park. RSVP Deadline is 4/22\, but as always\, earlier is appreciated. \nThis event has been approved by council as a "recruiting" campout\, so family members will be allowed to attend - with requirements... \n******\nALL individuals attending must have BSA Med forms parts A&B on file with the troop. If you're not sure please print and bring a copy to our troop meeting on April 30th\, 7pm\, at Park Hill Masonic Lodge. Fillable med forms available here: https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_AB.pdf\nALL adults in attendance must complete YPT training. If you are not a registered adult leader with Troop 62\, please email your YPT training certificate to troop62denver@gmail.com by April 23rd\, or you will not be permitted to attend. YPT is available free to all at: https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/ This takes about 30-40 minutes online and covers you for two years. \nYouth (<18) in attendance who are not members of Troop 62 must have a parent or guardian also attending. There are some policy questions on this one\, please inform us AsoonAP.\nFamily members and prospective troop members will be asked to contribute toward food and campsite costs ($30 per person)\, and will tent separately from the troop in the adjacent campsite. Webelos boys may camp with the troop depending on RSVP's and adult leader coverage. Where else can you get a guided tour of the sand and a weekend of food for $30?!?!?!\nCampers arriving for the optional Thursday night will need to either coordinate with each other or bring their own foods or both. Troop cooking begins with dinner Friday night and concludes with car snacks Sunday morning. \n*******\nGear: Overnight will be comfortable chilly and daytime sand 'can' 'reach' 120 degrees. There is a chance for weather and every trail involves things you don't want to barefoot on. Scouts have first dibs on troop tents and extra layers\, family members and visitors should be able to provide their own gear: Refer below for event-specific gear advice.\nActivity within your ability: Subarus are specifically banned from the Medano Creek road and first-time campers should NOT sign up for the backpacking overnight. Those allergic to dust might consider a different event and ALWAYS use the buddy system.\nConsider bringing these items\, in addition to the usual: towel\, sun shirt and/or extra sunscreen\, quick-drying clothes for creek fun\, water shoes/sacrificial sneakers. Also note that sand boards are available to rent (more info at: https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/sandboardingsandsledding.htm) \n******** \nPlan: ITS DIFFERENT THIS YEAR\, please read....exact plan will be posted here once SPL confirms.\nDune Area: Because we are camping inside the national park this year instead of at Oasis\, our access to the dunes is both easier and different. Saturday morning\, the troop will be cooking by 7am and departing by 830. We DO NOT plan on driving to the visitor lot this year. There will be a few vehicles going down\, but the majority of the dune-area 'volunteers' will be using the trail that leads directly from Pinon Flats campground\, about 2/3 mile downhill from camp. Because of later-day heat it is still encouraged that dune 'enjoyers' depart early morning and plan on lunch at high-dune. We DONT have to wake up at 4am this year. Even if Oren still wants you to.\nBackpacking Overnight. This is a four-scout high-adventure group. At time of edit\, you know who you are. This group will likely break fast Saturday with the rest of us mortals and then return after Sunday breakfast.\nMedano Road: High clearance\, 4WD/AWD\, 'non-subaru' ONLY. This is a really fun adventure that takes you to river-crossing 4 at this time of year. These seats will be first-come first-claimed. YPT must be followed\, and off-road etiquette obeyed.\nMedano Creek Splash: The troop will NOT BE at the visitor area parking lot crossing. We will be UPSTREAM a few minutes\, as the campground trail crosses about a half-mile upstream from the parking lot. We will likely have 2-5 greenish REI alcoves in a row and some exhausted parents in chairs. IF all dune-area 'visitors' elect to hike the dunes\, late arrivals can either rendezvous at the campsite for dinner\, with an adult who has cell phone reception\, or maintain station after-lunch at about 37 44' 46" N 105 30' 47" W or about here .\nZappatta Falls and Hike: Zappattatatpaa Falls is a must-see slot-canyon waterfall. Last year there was still some ice. A fewish years ago we stood under the water. It is an easy 20-minute stroll from the parking lot\, and COMPLETELY worth a visit. Zapattpta Hike starts near the falls and goes up into the greater Huerfano wilderness of Blanca and California peaks. Owen of H really wanted to just keep hiking. Henry of K actually knows people who live up there.\nVisitor Center: It's been under construction and as of edit\, status is unknown. But they do offer some key factoids\, passport stamps\, bathrooms with -gasp- soap and park bling. They usually have limited hours before Memorial day\, so plan ahead.\nTop-most-high-dune: This hike usually takes about 2 hours up\, resting frequently. We usually eat and play and take group pictures at the top and then resume the 30-minute fall back to the creek. It's so much fun! Because we are starting from a more-northerly place\, what appears to be high dune isn't. Please refer to Docs for dune advice.\n*********\nMeals: Scouts and Scouters will already have their own mess kits. Visitors are encouraged to bring durable non-fancy plate\, utensils cup that they don't mind being washed by teenagers. Or bring the bone-porcelain sets of the ancestors\, your choice. If you do not inform us of your dietary restrictions\, Walts Law says that this will be on the menu. Please let us know asap.\nOur scouts will be planning\, preparing\, serving and cleaning. Please feel free to take pictures\, but direct advice towards the program leaders\, I need all the help I can get.\n**********\nAsterisks: The fun damentals of this trip are: Scouting Fun. see what I did there? YPT will be followed. Beyond that\, if one car of people wants to do this within the program timeframe\, that's okay. If every single one of us decides to dig a giant mud hole in Medano Creek\, thats also (within park limitations) okay. Weather\, fire restrictions\, wildlife visitations\, and gravitational fluctuations are all a part of the program.\nMore troop plan details here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XcUhNbbDgYSu7JHis8BN2tKLL_tTI9wfuXFgyH1Dps/edit?usp=sharing\nScoutmaster Advices: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m3BK88rWoEfr0DjE_NHTjY2W4SLMnPvP69zaIzydmfo/edit?usp=sharing\n

SUMMARY:Snow Caves Winter Camping
DESCRIPTION:The Dread Update of Destiny\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4C2YT-4fpGHRlok0JiTGb4lczWKSlnE4LnCpL_8a1c/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHere is my scoutbook.com -deleting-proof google doc.  Also pasted here below but why do that to yourself.\nI wish you all the life-long ability to make durable\, warm and lasting shelters when in cold places.\nYIS\nNel\n\n>Begin Transmission<\n\nTroop 62 ‘Snow Caves’ 2024\n\nHallo and welcome to your brief introductory encyclopedia to basic snow shelters.\n\nThe delay in exact details on this trip are due to us waiting to find the most ideal conditions available and snow totals are short-term items.\n\n**The 48\,000-foot plan:\nSaturday\n7am:  Muster at the lodge for loadout.  We will pack troop gear\, choose meals\, assign car seats.\n945am:  Arrive trailhead with T262g\, our sister troop.\n1030am:  Serious snow moving underway.  ‘Tent buddies’ will be building their quinzhees.\n1230pm: Final building scoops are placed and lunch and/or lunch hike commences.\n230pm:  Hollow-ification.  Tent buddies dig out their sleeping quarters.\n500pm:  Dinner.  Yes.\n5:54pm: Sunset.\n630pm: Dishes are done.\n9pm: if any of you are still awake\, why?\n\nSunday\n630am:  Emerge victorious.\n715am: Breakfast!\n9am: pack-up completed\, begin Operation Destroy\n10am: Return to Car\n12pm: projected return to Lodge.\n1pm: projected scattering of Scout Force Snowblind to various residences/activities.\n\n\n\n\n**What to expect\, briefly:\n1. Snow up to and over the head height of your average scoutmaster.  This stuff comes in drifts and it’s all cold.\n2. Boots getting caught in the snow.  We will be coming up with a snow shoe/ski plan in the next two days.  When you begin wandering camp in your snow boots\, expect to find part of your legs under the surface.  Ideal Quinzhee conditions are 3’ plus deep on the level.  Plan on post-holing around until established.\n3.  Exhaustion.  But in a good way.  This is an extremely physical scouting event and that 9pm bedtime will feel like 4am by the time you get there.  Seriously.  Take regular sips of water and pace yourself.  The only prize for biggest shovel full of snow is more shovel fulls of snow.\n4.  Tight quarters.  If you suffer or enjoy claustrophobia\, this might not be your favorite way to overnight.  Picture yourself laying on your back on your sleep system.  Now look up about four inches to the domed ceiling of ice above your head.  I promise you it is  WAAAAY COOLER than it sounds\, but you have to experience it to believe it.  Those who simply cannot stand elevators will be invited to instead make snow trenches\, more on that later.\n5.  Snow positively everywhere.  By the time you get done piling the snow\, you might find yourself dressed down to a teeshirt and sunscreen.  By the time you finish digging out\, you will be 1004.84% soaked.  BRING A SECONDARY SNOW LAYER for after the dig-out.  You will be scraping and shaping snow above your head in close quarters\, there is simply no way anyone but Chris can do this without getting snow down their neck and sleeve.  This is normal.\n6.  Piling more snow.  If we make true quinzhees\, you will want to stop piling before it’s time.  No\, bad.  Do more.  Every two inches of dome gives you 2” more elbow space from your neighbors.\n9.  Silence.  A properly-built quinzhee is more effective at canceling the noise than a ‘photo radar in use ahead’ sign.  I can stand outside the doorway of a Quinzhee and shout\, you can’t hear me  same for the occupants.  It can be downright strange for city-raised campers.\n10.  Crawling.  Your shelter entrance will be at ground level and you will be crawling to get in and out.  There is data somewhere about bigger doors negating the warming effects of the dome\, but trust me.  Small door\, crawlspace.\n\n**How to things and thangs\n\n—Sleeping System:  Here’s mine\n\n-Tarp overtop everything but my face\n-Sleeping bag around the top\n-Me\n-Sleeping bag liner wrapped around me and my pillow\n-Sleeping bag around under me (Just to illustrate here that it goes around you)\n-Wool blanket\n-Closed Cell foam pad\n-Air mattress (small personal sized thermarestish kind)\n-Tarp underneath everything\n\nThe ‘sleeping system’ refers to the whole conglomerate of layers your are using to keep yourself warm and toasty.  You are literally sleeping on a bed of insulating ice\, under a dome of insulating ice.  The ‘R Value’ is the percentage of body heat lost to radiation/convection/stubborness.  In the winter\, you will always need as much or more R value UNDER your body as you will above it.\n\n\n—Quinzhee:  this is an art and some science\, every condition is different and methods must adjust to reality.\n\n-Snow is piled in a circular dome and left to ‘cinter’  The outer layer that becomes the wall MUST be in contact with the ground.  \n-The snow in the sleeping area should be tested for depth/obstructions\, but left as completely alone as possible.  Why compact that which you are going to be digging out.  The wall has to be structural\, not the balloon at the middle of the paper mache.\n-Dig down to the ground all the way around the central space\, throwing that snow into the the pile growing at the middle.\n-Every shovel of snow you move should contribute to the dome.\n-Once you have reached the size of the inside of the dome\, start tamping the snow every so often to give strength.\n-Once forming the wall STAY OFF OF IT….\n-Throw a few scoops of snow at the pile\, tamp it lightly.  Throw a few scoops of snow at the pile\, tamp it lightly.  Hydrate.  Repeat.\n-Once elders have approved your pile\, you will insert the marking devices all the way around the pile.  These will freeze in place and are to be the length of the desired wall thickness.  When digging out from the inside\, you will hopefully find the tip of the marker before you find the outside of the dome.\n-It is then hollowed out until there is enough sleeping space inside OR the walls cannot be any thinner.  WHICHEVER COME FIRST.  When moving towards the outside take swipes of snow off\, not jabs.\n++++++++While digging out\, and this is IMPORTANT\, the buddy team is completely and utterly mandatory.  Your buddy will be crouched at the doorway while you hollow the dome out\, not standing in the area\, not chatting with the others or making yellow snow\, no.  You must remain in a position to both call for help and immediately begin to dig if a cave-in happens.\n++++++++While digging out\, in shifts\, working slowly and methodically\, please never be scooping directly above your face.  This is bad juju and also horrible of keeping your face ice-free.\n++++++++While being the outside part of the team you will scoop away all of the snow your mole is pushing towards you\, because that is both the exit and the airway.  This is not a race\, this is shelter building.  Once the interior is big enough\, the mole will be kicking/shoveling snow at the entrance\, you’ll need to reach in to remove it.\n-Picture yourself sitting on the floor with your legs crossed under you and your back hunched.  Stay in that position.  Put your right fist by your right ear and hold it with your left hand.  Now swipe your hands down and across to your left hip\, in an arc close to your body.  This is a ‘swipe’.  You are NOT stabbing your shovel into the structure\, you are shaving off arc-shaped scoops with the side of your shovel blade.\n-There should be a slightly-raised bed of snow/ice inside and a lower space that allows colder air to NOT pool around your self.  \n-The ceiling should be smoothed to mitigate dripscicles directly over your forehead.\n-There WILL BE an air hole opposite the door\, this WILL NOT be due to the wall being too thin…… … …ahem…Adrew…\n-In the morning\, you will have solidified the interior of the dome with the warmth of your breath.  You will also find that the entire patrol can stand upon the dome with nary a budge.  I’m that old.\n-Before leaving camp you will reduce the shelter to a non-wildlife-hazard.\n\n\n—Snow Trench:  This is a fast shelter\, is not entirely windproof and is usually whatever temperature the outside air is.\n\n-Suitable flat terrain is chosen.  Dig a straight/compacted wall holw rectangularly down to withing 6” of the ground.  The rectangle should be 12” longer front to back than you are tall\, and twice as wide as your sleep system.  This means my snow trench will be a rectangle about 7 feet by 5 feet.  Leave teh 6” of snow that will be under your sleep system\, take the other half (or the space between tent buddies) down to the ground.  Make sure to give plenty of drain space for the cold air to stay away.\n-Logs or simple tarp strew over the top of the trench are a really good idea.  I usually try to have at least tree branches stick under my tarp.\n-Edges of the over top tarp are buried securly in snow around the outside snow layers.  This is your roof.\n\n\n\n\n—Snow Tunnel:  This is hard to achieve without hiking out into the truly-deep snow but it has happened to me so I’ll briefly cover it here.\n\n-If the snow is 5’ or  more deep.  Chose the best looking location in the area\, reaching out with your senses to gauge the shape of the forest floor underneath all that snow.  DO NOT disturb the area that will become your dome YET.\n-Snowshoe around the perimeter and probe with your sticks the depth. Hard-feeling differences in depth indicate buried objects.  \n-Choose your entrance location and DSD (dig straight down) to the ground\, throwing the removed snow evenly across the whole shelter roof.  Tamping down lightly and you go.  \n-Dig in\, with your buddy throwing the removed snow all across the dome area.  A probe should show no more than 40” of roof thickness and likely no less than 14” of snow thickness.\n-dome it out\, shape your sleeping shelves and enjoy.\n\n\n—Tent:  You maniac.  When Scouts found a fallen tree or a boulder or a stump place squarely across one\, two or all of the interior sleeping spaces\, they were out of time and energy and instead went to the tent option.\n-I always set my tent onto the flatest\, most wind-sheltered piece of snow as possible\,  no need to dig down\, because stakes won’t go in anyway.  USE SNOW ANCHORS for the corners and fly tie-downs.\n\n\n—Hammock:  Your own skill will dictate\, but here’s mine:\n\n-dig down to the ground underneath the sleeping area\, embed the edges of the tarp into either the top of the snow layer or near the floo.  Leave planty of extra inches between your sleeping system and potential snow-loading of the overhead tarp.  Leave a vapor exit and minimal ventilation to assist.  Cover your pack and gear.\n—Boots.  Many of you only have one pair of snow boots.  Tennis shoes\, hiking shoes\, crocs are completely forbidden.  If you do not have snow boots\, you must have them to participate.\n\n-Highly recommend gators.  Cannot recommend this enough.  The snow slieve of snowpant legs is good but not good enough.\n-Overnight freezing\, Oren\, WILL HAPPEN.  Do not put them into your sleeping bag because you’ll melt the ice and snow while inside your sleeping bag.\n-When finally removing your boots for the night\, i suggest you loosen the laces as much as possible without unlacing the eyelets\, open the tongue out way more than you think you’ll need. Leave them in a safe place that is not outside in the falling snow.\n-In the morning\, they will likely be frozen.  So now you just shove your foot into the wide-open partially-solid snow booth and work the laces closed.\n-If you do not do this\, and let your boots freeze in small shapes\, getting a foot in can be difficult.\n\n—Gloves\, Hats\, Hoods\, flashlights.\n-Please have two pairs of gloves.  This is good for at home anyway.  One pair for getting warm again before bed\, the other to get soaked during the build.  Drying out gloves is not an option on this trip.\n-Sleeping beanie.  A close fitting comfortable hat to wear upon your hair while sleeping.  Must be kept dry until bedtime.\n-The hood of your winter coat can be both your best ally against falling snow inside the dig-out and your worst enemy when trying to see over your shoulder.  Use wisely and patiently.\n-Flashlight.  You will need a light source inside the shelter.  You will need a light source inside the shelter.\n\n—Pee.\n-waking up to go pee will involve getting out of your sleep system while under the equivalent of the coffee table without touching the coffee table\, dressing in same space then wriggling out into the cold to pee.\n-you will also need to take a buddy\, who will need to get dressed against possible -30f apparent weather outside the shelter.\n-go pee whatever pee you can pee BEFORE going to bed.\n\n—Hydration.\n-We will be boiling snow the entire time.  Taking a dried bottle of warm water into the sleeping bag with you can be a Game Changer.  \n-You might be moving multiple tons of snow per person and you will be at altitude.  You will be sweating.  Scott thrice passed out in the snow from dehydration (different Scott) don’t be that guy.\n-Sips.  Taking gulps can lead to core temperature decrease\, stomach cramps and bad times.  Sippit. Sippit slow.\n\n—The experience\n-Those of you brave enough and lucky enough to get to do this will ALWAYS remember it.  I’ve don’t this a few times and it never gets old.  The utter silence.  The cliff-like dome of ice above your pillow.  Being too warm in a sleeping bag when the outside temp is deadly.  The satisfaction of putting it the effort and making it through.  Coming out in the morning.  Breaking the thing.  \n-This is easily one of the most satisfying shelters you will overnight in this year\, maybe this entire life.\n—Gear:\n\n A big shovel per person.  Snow shovels from home if you have to\, be prepared for them to break.\nA small shovel per person.  The old folding GI shovels with a flipping blade the size of your hand is good.  I also use an avalanche scoop and a ‘Bear Claw’ snow blade.\nWater bottles.  This will be out in the elements the whole time.  Nalgenes are best\, bladders will freese.\nSleeping Pads.  The troop has a couple extra pads\, but a closed cell pad is an absolute must for your own personal gear.\nTarps.  One under\, one over.  Drips from above\, melts from below.\nBook.  I almost always read by candle/lamp light.  The cozy quinzhee is ideal for some pages turned.\nMess kit.  Our menu will include the need to eat.  Please bring it.\nNormal packing list\, winter gear.  But please double up on socks\, jackets\, gloves\, snowpants and beanies\n\n—Closing Thoughts:\nSmall branches and evergreen sprigs can be used to mark the maximum dig-out depth but it is hard to judge how much snow you’ve piled on top of them.\nSame with dirt/gravel\, but that will result in some mud on gear.\nTake your time.  This trip is scheduled and planned for you to learn how to to practice your snow shelter build\, not actually stay a month in it or hide from emergencies.  We are planning of one night and coming home.  This is about the build\, and it is not a race.\nBoots.  I mean it.  \nSNOW SHOES.  If you have XC skis\, then fine.  Be all fast and stealthy.  We will likely be renting a number of snow shoes for this one\, details to follow.\nDietary restrictions.  We do have people who cannot main-line deep-fried bacon.  Our menu will build body heat\, soul warmth and body sustenance.  You can and will learn how to do dishes in the snow.  It’s nothing compared to raising a teenager.\nFun.  You.  Will.   Have.  It.\n\nMore thoughts to come but it’s late and a lot of people made rank tonight.\n\nYours in Scouting\nNel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnowCaves campout - Winter Camping\n\n2.12.24 Update:\nA few questions have come up - this campout will leave Saturday AM and return Sunday afternoon - 1 night only\n\nLocation TBD- will wait till closer to date to call about snowpack in a few locations.\n\nLeave Saturday Morning: Time TBD as it depends on where we go.\nDig out snow caves or build up Quinzhees! \n - layers is critical for this trip as you get sweaty while digging and building... dry clothes to sleep in is CRITICAL!\nSunday:\n  Wake up and eat\n  Destroy snow caves -Leave no trace\n  Head home \nMore details to come at Tuesday meetings\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XcUhNbbDgYSu7JHis8BN2tKLL_tTI9wfuXFgyH1Dps/edit?usp=sharing\n\n

SUMMARY:Klondike
DESCRIPTION:Feb 7 update\n\nThis is mostly directed at T62b youth leaders\, but I included it here if ya'll forgot how long my scoutmaster minutes are\, enjoy!\nWe are limited in our departure time by the fact that district-level-scouters forgot that our drivers work on Fridays\, but hopefully we will make the SPL meeting.  Owen\, they are asking for just you and I: small tent\, big group (thirty troops).\nSchedule of Events:Friday:6pm depart Lodge.  Arrive 730ish.  Immediately begin setting up the tents for those tenting\, maybe those should be on top...8:00 boil water for overnight water

spicy. and boil the water.4:00  Break camp and prepare dinner.  Any gear not already packed to get packed.  I once had this meal when I was in your shows and remembered liking it a lot for all the effort it took the leaders ahead of time.5ish   Eat it.  maybe fire\, maybe not.  trucking out hot ashes is no fun indeed.8:00  Call Jonas' dad to come rescue us for eight feet\, then restart the Red Forerunner and leaf!9:30pm RTB\, distribute personals and leave.  take a shower....Unload troop gear just before next meeting while Webelos cook something and watch you toil...\nFood:  Ideally we need to only use utensils for all of this\, except for the skillets and big pot and ladle.  There should be simple dish line: one soap\, one rinse.  YOU WILL ALL PRE CLEAN your utensils and other implementations.  Ideally you will need your cups for coffee and your spoons....\n\nCrackerbarrel:  pre-scliced cheese tray\, fruit containers\, some kind of candy that doesn't involve 2.2 billion wrappers.\n-Breakfast*Overnight oats:  Rolled oats\, oat milk\, yogurt\, cow milk\, blueberries/raspberries\, Chia\, cinnamon\, honey/agave\, peanut butter powder\, nuts\, chocolate ships.  In Solo Cups.  If you do not enjoy this improved version of Jonas' meal\, you will enjoy it anyway.*Bacon:  Pre-cooked bacon.  please.  no more greascicles ever....\n-Snack:\nBObos trail happies and bars-Lunch:  \n*REI space meals.  pick your own and EAT it.  these' don't grow on trees.*Apples\, Mini Oranges\, Ritz Crackers and cheese slices  These do grow on trees.-Snack:\nBObos trail happies and bars-Dinner:\n*Rebaked Potaytoes 2ways  (Goldens and Sweets).  These will be pre wrapped in cooked aluminum and we will heat them back up enough to be satisfying\, keeping in mind that the coals and the ovens need to be transported out when we leave.  so DO NOT DELAY the start....*Toppings:  Butter\, Oil of Olive\, Shredded cheddar\, Bacon bits\, squeezey Sour Cream\, Chives/green onions\, horribly spicy sauce of some kind\, marshmallows\, Salt\, other things to put onto baked starches.\nGear:*Water Bottle.  You will be exercising in the snow.  ACTUAL water bottles of durable construction and unique appearance.  No disposables please.  Also do not recommend bladders.*Boots.  Last year there was still ~20 inches on the ground\, this year there should be more.  Tennis shoes are fine for the car\, but only if there is enough room for both.*Layers.  You will be alternately cold and overheated.  A good under layer close to your skin.  One or two layers you can remove when needed.  Outer water-proof layer.  Hat that keeps your heat in.  Socks that can stand up to abuse.*Water Bottle.  Sledzilla is amazing and heavy.  You will also be lugging the weight of our gear in it.  You will get dehydrated.  What rhymes with 'fill your bottle before you leave camp'?*11+ Essentials.  In my day the lashing station was only completed by patrols who brought their own 100' ropes per person.  Same for the first aid station\, fire lighting station\, tarpoleen station\, etc.  Have your essentials in your day bag before you leave your tent and save Owen some stress.*Snow Shoes.  There was a blurb about an optional snowshoe trek.  If there is room in the trailer and yours are marked in a way you can get them back\, okay to bring.*Hydration Container.  When you feel thirsty. drink it.  When you feel headache and grumpy\, you should have already been taking sips.*sunscreen and sunglasses.  I have personally gone snow blind in this environment and do not recommend it.  Also\, just because it's only your face showing doesn't mean the UV bouncing off the snow can't burn your nostrils.*Day pack.  If you have to\, school type backpacks will suffice.  please take the school out of them before leaving home.  This is the easiest way to keep the Assembled Blue Tank (ABT) organized.*Handwarmers.  Some of you do not have body fat.  Handwarmers that are not dropped into the snow are ideal.*Hot Water Bottles.  If the lid is entirely leak proof\, putting a bottle of warm water in the foot of your bag overnight is huge.  Wet sleeping bags notsomcuh.*Ground pad.  Some of you will decide to dig down to the surface of that mountain.  Please have something between your bag and that cold.*headlamp and work gloves.  Setting up a tent in the snow in the dark is just something we do here in the Rockies.  But\, you won't like holding a flashlight at the same time.*Spoons.  Our menu calls for spoons.  please bring yours.*Cups.  Daniel is not allowed to spread bad habits to the next class.  Please mix your Dietler Diesel in a cup that does not have a lid.  Owen will be pleased to task Daniel to show you how to clean it asap.*Water Bottle.  Seriously.  That one scout that decided to warm up snow by shoving it into a flexible bladder then melting it under an armpit needs to be the only one ever to not have a durable water container at this car camping event.*Means of calling home.  Our return is only an estimated time\, you  will need to phone ahead to make sure you don't get to mop the floor at the lodge Saturday night while waiting for a PU.\nAs far as weather goes\, we are lucky this year.  This is always heap big fun and I am looking forward to seeing you there.YISNel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.22.24 Update:\n\nTuesday evening at midnight is the

Council is requesting a list of all participants this week.\n\nCamping is confirmed for 1 night only: \nArrive Friday night - Tent camping\nSaturday - full day of Activities\nSaturday  late afternoon/evening-  pack up tents and eat a warm meal before departure.\nDeparture is at night after the sun goes down\, but you get a warm bed that evening vs wet snowy clothes!\n\n2024 Alpine\, Frontier\, and Valley Klondike\n\nFebruary 9-10\n\n\nTime \nCheck in starts 3pm Friday\, February 9 \,2024\nProgram starts 9AM Saturday\, February 10\, 2024\nDeparture is at around 7-8PM Saturday\, February 10\, 2024\n\nLocation:\nGolden Gate State Park Reverends Ridge Campsite (313 Reverends Ridge Road\, Black Hawk\, Colorado 80403)\n\n\n

SUMMARY:T62 TH Foodies Update
DESCRIPTION:Hallo and welcome to your last update (cough) on this weekends camping trip! yaayyy...\n-We will be camping in hte Northern side of camp\, found here.  From 72\, turn west (towards Japan) on "state road 96"/"Beaver Reservoir Rd"/"Camp Tumblesome Rd".  Go PAST the camp entry AND parking lot on the left and turn right into the ditch\, or road\, on the right.  We will be camping past the buildings in the meadow\, "Black Thumb".  Parking is along the road once you pass the shipping containers.\n-Saturday lunch\, we will be sharing the pavillion with a whole group of former Tahosa staph members.  For the rest of the trip\, we will be attempting to 'outcook' our fellows from 262g.\n-Service Project:  Since YMCA took over the ranch last year\, they have suffered a blow-down and need some help.  Brave adults from both units will be spending a couple hours Saturday morning utilizing saw chains\, keep us in your thoughts.  After Lunch our combined mob of youth will be getting actual conservation service hours helping to clear the campsites!  Yaaaay!\n***BRING WORK GLOVES!!!!*****  sappy\, pointy\, heavy logs and branches are in your future and blisters are no fun.\n-Water:  We will be bringing all the water we need with us\, there is none on-ranch.  Which means\, you WILL clean your mess kit before taking it to the wash line....\n-Latrines:   T 262 will be using the latrine just east (towards Springfield) of the pavillion.  T 62 will be using the black thumb latrines north (towards Eastes Park) of the pavillions.  There will be no exceptions.\n-FOOD\, finally\, food.  While the competition is real\, the cake is a lie.  Each patrol MUST conserve their use of the unit gear\, so that we can all dine in style.  Keep your knowledge of cross-contamination at hand.  If you have questions on how to reduce your utensil footprint\, please ask before you use my salmon spatula to stir your raw eggs.  Please consult with your patrol leaders before hand so that everyone knows their task.  I hear 262 will be enjoying fresh-made pasta.....\nSee you at 5!&nbsp;\nYIS\, Nel\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Intro to Leadership Skills for Troops (ILST) opportunity
DESCRIPTION:No need to RSVP - just sign up using the link below. \nFREE opportunity shared with our troop to complete ILST (Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops)\, which is required for youth who will participate in NYLT this summer\, and recommend for all youth taking on leadership positions within the troop. \n\nhttps://denverboyscouts.doubleknot.com/registration/calendardetail.aspx?activitykey=3042908\n\nWhat is ILST (Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops)?  Basically\, ILST provides training for youth leaders so that they can experience success in their positions of responsibility in their home troops.  ILST aims to explain the troop youth positions hierarchy\, teach organizational skills to help Scouts find success\, and demonstrate leadership skills\, such as conflict management and communication skills\, that Scouts can then use to lead effectively.\n\nWhy is this ILST unique?  This ILST is being presented by a group of Older Youth in our Council - the Venturing Officers Association\, the Sea Scouts Quarterdeck\, and older NYLT (National Youth Leadership Training) staff members who have a great deal of experience teaching and implementing the skills covered in ILST.  Also\, ILST is a prerequisite for attending more advanced leadership training\, such as NYLT and  NAYLE.  And\, better yet\, the training is FREE!\n\nThe class will run from 9am-noon - bring a water bottle\, notebook and pen\, or electronic note-taking device.

DESCRIPTION:Youth and adults attending Camp Loll\nHere is our final meeting before the journey to Camp Loll. for those out of town\, i will try to set up a zoom or google meet link\nDuring this meeting we will have both adults and Youth meet who are attending. we will split up the Youth and adults to finalize plans.\nYouth: a few things to iron out and Plan prior to arrival.\n1.	Troop 62 cheer  at Flags every morning each troop has a 10-20 cheer they shout& we could improve from last years.  Let try and make a good one and be Loud and Proud\n2.	Duty assignment  I have a spreadsheet to help you facilitate.  This will help camp run smoother as everyone knows their roles and responsibilities prior to arrival.\na.	 Fireguard  Different youth each day per campsite&nbsp;\nb.	Bear Warden- Different youth each day per campsite\nc.	Axe yard Warden- Different youth each day per campsite\nd.	Cooking Crew &amp; Clean up Crew I suggest you split into 2 groups per campsite and that group will cook all meals for the day and the other cleans\, and then switch the next day. Youre in charge so will let you battle it out but trying to provide a suggestion\n3.	Overnight Canoe- this is out posting on the other side of the lake\n4.	Preliminary Hike Day signups  we will have multiple hikes to choose from and can split into groups& it would be nice to have a list of what hikes everyone wants to do prior arriving.. we can finalize once we are there.\nPacking list:\nTents  Youth will pair up with troop tents\, Youth can bring their own if they want. Adults should bring their own tents.\n-	Campsites are small and tough to accommodate large tents. No larger than 2 person tents are advised\nSleeping bag\nSleep Pad\nMess Kit We are patrol cooking\nCamp Chair\nHead net for mosquitos\nSunscreen\nBug spray\nI am sure there is more as well and we will iron it all out!\nThanks\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
